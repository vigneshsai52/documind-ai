## ⚡ The Problem

People sign contracts every day without understanding them:
- Employment agreements with hidden non-competes
- Rental leases with unfair penalties  
- Service contracts with auto-renewal traps
- NDAs that are way too broad

**Lawyers cost $300-500/hour.** Most people can't afford that.

## ✅ The Solution

ContractScan uses AI to make contract review **free and accessible**:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| 📋 **Contract Type Detection** | Identifies what kind of contract it is |
| 👥 **Party Extraction** | Who's involved and their roles |
| 📅 **Key Dates** | Deadlines, start/end dates, milestones |
| 💰 **Financial Terms** | Payments, penalties, fees, hidden costs |
| ⚠️ **Risk Detection** | Flags HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk clauses |
| ❓ **Missing Clauses** | Standard protections that should be there |
| 📝 **Plain English Summary** | Explains what you're actually agreeing to |

## 📊 Example Analysis

**Input:** Employment contract PDF

**Output:**
📋 CONTRACT TYPE Employment Agreement
👥 PARTIES INVOLVED • Employee: John Doe • Employer: TechCorp Inc.
📅 KEY DATES & DEADLINES • Start Date: January 15, 2024 • Review Period: 90 days • Notice Period: 30 days
💰 FINANCIAL TERMS • Salary: $85,000/year • Bonus: Up to 10% based on performance • Health insurance: Employer pays 80%
⚠️ RISKY CLAUSES 🔴 HIGH RISK: Non-compete clause prevents working in same industry for 2 years after leaving 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Intellectual property assignment is very broad 🟢 LOW RISK: 30-day termination notice is shorter than standard 60 days
❓ MISSING STANDARD CLAUSES • Severance package details • Remote work policy • Expense reimbursement procedure
📝 PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY You're agreeing to work for TechCorp for $85k/year. The big red flag is the non-compete — you can't work in tech for 2 years if you leave. Also, they own everything you create, even outside work hours. Consider negotiating these points before signing.
